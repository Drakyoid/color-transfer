CPSC4040 FINAL

Description:
This code reads in a source image and a destination image, then using
the approach in Reinhard et al, transfers the colors from the source
image to the destination image, then displays the result.
Recommended to use images that are similar otherwise there may be artifacts.

How to run:
First compile with 'make'
Type ./colortransfer source.png destination.png [outimage.png]

Once image is displayed:
'W' or 'w' to write the displayed image to a file
'q' or 'esc' is to quit
